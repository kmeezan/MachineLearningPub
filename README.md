Machine Learning projects 

The purpose of this repository is to share the Machine Learning projects that I have worked on. 

The projects are summarized in the PDF document ML_Summary.pdf (https://github.com/kmeezan/MachineLearningPub/blob/master/ML_summary.pdf)

The projects posted here are follow-ups to the feed-forward back propagation network I wrote using Python for CS 3B at Foothill. The project required an interactive command line program in which the user selects a data set and can interactively build and run the network. The project is summarized in this video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sx-b2J2pr9o)

The projects in this directory use Google CoLab Tensor Flow notebooks. These are an excellent teaching tool because they allow extensive use of text comments and graphics, and also allow you to run specific pieces of your code individually. 
You are encouraged to share these for academic purposes. Please attribute the author:
