Machine Learning projects 

The purpose of this repository is to share Machine Learning projects. The projects use Google CoLab Tensor Flow notebooks. These are an excellent teaching tool because they allow extensive use of text comments and graphics, and also allow you to run specific pieces of your code individually. 
You are encouraged to share these for academic purposes. Please attribute the author:
